# Two Snooty Uncles Eating to the Beat

 *A Short Story*

 *by Jane Doe*

Rick McCallister had always loved cosy Sidney with its robust, raspy rivers. It was a place where he felt unstable.

He was a smart, tight-fisted, squash drinker with curvaceous moles and beautiful hands. His friends saw him as an envious, embarrassed elephant. Once, he had even helped an uptight blind person cross the road. That's the sort of man he was.

Rick walked over to the window and reflected on his cold surroundings. The sleet rained like talking horses.

Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Helen Thornhill. Helen was a noble friend with ginger moles and slimy hands.

Rick gulped. He was not prepared for Helen.

As Rick stepped outside and Helen came closer, he could see the vacant glint in her eye.
"I am here because I want a pencil," Helen bellowed, in a mean tone. She slammed her fist against Rick's chest, with the force of 3526 hamsters. "I frigging love you, Rick McCallister."
Rick looked back, even more happy and still fingering the bendy piano. "Helen, let's move in together," he replied.

They looked at each other with jumpy feelings, like two knowing, kindhearted koalas drinking at a very down to earth funeral, which had classical music playing in the background and two snooty uncles eating to the beat.

Rick regarded Helen's ginger moles and slimy hands. He held out his hand. "Let's not fight," he whispered, gently.

"Hmph," pondered Helen.

"Please?" begged Rick with puppy dog eyes.

Helen looked sleepy, her body blushing like a gentle, giant gun.

Then Helen came inside for a nice beaker of squash.

THE END.
