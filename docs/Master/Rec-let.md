## Subject: Recommendation letter for MoSIG application ##

&nbsp;

To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Ho Bich Hai. It is my pleasure to recommend Lam Dang to your program, Master of Science in Informatics at Grenoble. Mr. Dang has been a remarkably driven assistant and a valuable asset to our project illustrated by my points below. About the project, we have been working on unified access to genomics databases regarding rice (*oryza sativa*). Lam has rewritten execution code in Python that resulted in a product beyond satisfaction.

In addition to his excellent work, there are other qualities about his workstyle that I would like to note in this letter. First, I would like to note Lam's outstanding capability to communicate with me as his supervisor. Our workflow entails outlining details and executing upon tight schedule and strict deadlines. Lam's ability to communicate well has made this process remarkably easy for both of us and enhanced productivity. Regarding my work nature, I need to work remotely often. Still, Lam manages to report his progress to me on a frequent basis and through Asana, he made it easy for me to keep track with his work.

Second, his initiative is far beyond expectation. In our group discussions, Lam has been the most proactive in contributing ideas to solve those problems and discussing solutions with team members. One time he initiated to offer a function to resolve a member's difficulty to merge two interdependent parts of work from two Python and R scripts, which allowed the member to proceed with his next step. This is only one circumstance that exemplifies his tendency to go far beyond his own work which is already superb.

In short, Lam has both excellent attention to details and a grasp for big picture that facilitates any project he is a part of. Your program will equip him with more cutting-edge skillsets in Data Science and further his success. Therefore, I strongly recommend him for your Master's program.

&nbsp;

Sincerely,

&nbsp;
