# Grenoble Application/Motivation letter

## What is your long-terme professional ambition

I wish to be an expert in computer science and gain competence to solve complex interdisciplinary problems, both technical and theoretical ones, with data science tools.

## How will the master academic program you apply for help you to reach this ambition

As a student of science, I have interests across many different fields of expertise, and Data Science is the tool and methodology for me to understand complex problems in the world. I strongly believe that such a dynamic course structure offered by Grenoble INP will not only strengthen my understanding of mathematics, algorithm, and computer science, but also prepare me for application to other fields and for a long and successful scientific career.

## Is there any academic group you would like to work with and why ? Have you made contacts with any professors or researchers

## Any other important information we should kno about your candidature

As a student at USTH, I have not limited my learning to computer science. During the 2nd year of my undergraduate career, I founded a FabLab (FabLab USTH) and was subsequently awarded a 3-month scholarship to Boston, MA, USA to confer with the people who initiated the concept of FabLab at MIT and other FabLabs around the world - within the framework of the FAB11 conference and the DPI programme. FabLab USTH is one of the few FabLabs in the world that was founded and currently maintained exclusively by students, aiming at multidisciplinary research and development.
