## Any other important information we should kno about your candidature

As a student at USTH, I does not limited myself to the expertise of my speciality. During my 2nd year of the bachelor program, I have founded a FabLab (FabLab USTH) and subsequentially awarded a 3 month scholarship to Boston, MA, USA to confer with the people who originated the concept of FabLab at MIT and other FabLab around the world - within the framework of FAB11 conference and DPI programme. FabLab USTH is one of the few FabLab in the world that was founded and currently maintained exclusively by students, aiming at multidisciplinary research and development.
