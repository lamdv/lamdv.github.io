# Where to start with Python

The other day there was another student asked me how to start with infomatics and computer science (and of course, AI). My answer is, of course, with Python.

Now, why is Python the perfect language for starter in Comp Sci as well as AI? Simply put, Python got it right between readability, simplicity and performance. When I first started with programming, there was Pascal, C and BASIC, all was heavy hitter and formal programming languages. They are not really readability and friendly, and often it is easier to rewrite than reread - this is still the common practise for small to medium projects. However they are close to native code and can be used to perform time critical and intricate codes. Once we get to a certain proficient with programming, it is always recommended to start learning a "real" programming language - the modern languages are C++, Java and of course, Python

On the other end of the spectrum, there is Scratch and to some extend, JavaScript and Lua Script. These so called scripting programming language is easier to grasp and eaiser to learn, with less formalism and more abundent
