My name is Lam, Dang. I'm a master student at UGA's MoSIG program (Grenoble, France). My speciality including Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence and Data Retrieval.

For the last year I have been working on a bioinformatic project, developing an engine to query from multiple genomics databases.

Beside working in informatics, I am also the founder of a Fab Lab and Technology Club at USTH. Builder of several machines and design, I am well versed in (very informal) mechanical design and CAD/CAM. Favorite flavor of CAD: Fusion 360.
